We have lots of different ways of staying in touch!

**Our preferred way to answer questions** is via our forum
[Neurostars](https://neurostars.org/tags/bids) (we have a 90%+ answer rate!)

We understand that posting a question on a forum can seem a bit uncertain and intimidating.
However, if _you_ have a question it's almost certain that somebody else will too,
and this way we can avoid answering the same question multiple times.
Even if your question is not well-defined,
just post what you have so far and we will be able to point you in the right direction!

Some example questions that have already been answered include:

-   [BIDS file naming specifications](https://neurostars.org/t/bids-beginner-convert-data-to-bids-format/1364)
-   [BIDS beginner - convert data to BIDS format](https://neurostars.org/t/bids-beginner-convert-data-to-bids-format/1364)
